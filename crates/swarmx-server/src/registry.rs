//! Per-agent registry: holds the live `PtyBridge`s keyed by agent id.
//!
//! Each agent owns:
//!  - a `PtyBridge` (the PTY + child),
//!  - a shared `PtyStream` ring buffer (M3): the PTY-reader background task
//!    appends every chunk here; one or more WS subscribers each hold their
//!    own cursor and replay/follow from the buffer. Replaces the M1
//!    single-consumer `output_rx` claim.
//!  - a clone of the input `Sender` (to inject keystrokes).
//!
//! Storage is a `DashMap<AgentId, Arc<Mutex<AgentSlot>>>` so HTTP and WS
//! handlers can claim/release independently without serialising the whole
//! map.

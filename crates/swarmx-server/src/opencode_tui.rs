//! Drive opencode's TUI over its built-in HTTP control API.
//!
//! opencode runs as a full-screen TUI in the PTY (so the terminal view and the
//! asciicast recordings work exactly like claude/codex), but its TUI cannot
//! reliably accept a *large* bootstrap prompt via keystroke injection: a
//! ~24k-char bracketed paste parks the TUI at READY without ever submitting
//! (verified live, opencode 1.17.7). opencode's own remedy is the documented
//! `/tui/*` HTTP endpoints its embedded server exposes — the same control
//! surface its browser extension drives. So swarmx spawns the TUI with a
//! known per-agent `--port <p>` and POSTs the prompt instead of faking
//! keystrokes: deterministic and size-independent.
//!
//! Used for BOTH the first-turn bootstrap and every wake "kick" for opencode
//! agents (claude/codex keep their keystroke path). A slot exposes its port via
//! `AgentSlot::tui_http_port()`; `Some(port)` is the signal to deliver here.
//!
//! TIMING (the load-bearing subtlety): opencode's TUI takes several seconds to
//! cold-start, and a `/tui/submit-prompt` sent before it's fully ready returns
//! 200 but is a **no-op** — the prompt sits in the input box and is never
//! submitted, so the model is never called and the captain parks forever (which
//! the first-response watchdog then misreads as "未登录"). The bootstrap path
//! therefore does NOT trust a single submit: it re-submits until opencode
//! actually starts a turn (a new input-bearing session appears) — see
//! [`deliver_bootstrap`]. Wakes hit an already-warm TUI, so [`deliver_turn`]
//! submits once.

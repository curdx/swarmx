//! Per-CLI behavior adapters.
//!
//! swarmx drives several coding CLIs — claude, codex, opencode — through one
//! spawn pipeline. Everything those CLIs DISAGREE on lives here, ONE
//! self-contained module per CLI:
//!   - where per-workspace trust is recorded,
//!   - how the swarmx-swarm MCP server is injected,
//!   - how the wake hook is installed,
//!   - which argv / env a headless launch needs,
//!   - how a turn's prompt is delivered (keystroke vs opencode's TUI HTTP API).
//!
//! The GENERIC machinery (PTY pump, ready-plan dialog answerer, health scanner,
//! model/effort overlay) lives in `spawn.rs` and never branches on a CLI id — it
//! asks the adapter at each seam.
//!
//! Adding a CLI is therefore additive and local: drop a `cli/<name>.rs`
//! implementing [`CliAdapter`], add one arm to [`adapter_for`], and ship a
//! `cli-plugins/<name>.toml`. If the new CLI reuses an existing family's config
//! formats, the first two steps collapse to "nothing" — [`adapter_for`] already
//! routes it. Two CLIs never share a function body by accident; they are
//! dispatched as separate objects.

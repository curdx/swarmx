## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-21

「Mission Control」体验重构 + SwarmX 品牌。Agent 冷启动不再黑盒,「需要我」
有了全局收件箱,onboarding 改成任务式,深浅主题一键切换,产品有了自己的标。

### Added
- **冷启动阶段条**:new `agent_stage` WS event (shim_ready → mcp_ready →
  bootstrap_injected); dispatch cards render a four-step stage chain
  (拉起 agent → 启动 CLI → 挂载 swarm 工具 → 注入任务), completed chain shown
  on ready too.
- **「需要我」全局收件箱** (`deriveNeedsYou` + NeedsYouBar): agents that are
  errored or exited-without-handoff aggregate into a top strip, one click to
  the drawer; empty means it disappears.
- **Thinking-liveness pulses in the transcript tailer**: kimi `llm.request`,
  codex `reasoning`, claude `thinking` blocks now emit system-level activity,
  so long reasoning keeps `last_activity_at` fresh — slow-but-alive is
  distinguishable from wedged.
- **Theme quick-toggle** in the activity bar footer (light → dark → system).
- **SwarmX brand mark**: four worker nodes forming an X around a captain node;
  one source (`Brand.tsx`) feeding the top bar, favicon, and the full Tauri
  icon set (mac/Windows/Linux/iOS/Android).

### Changed
- Onboarding is task-driven: reworked empty-state starters (first one demos a
  swarm dispatch); the 4-step tour overlay is retired.
- 11 views' empty states unified: icon + what-appears-here + how-to-make-it +
  primary action where meaningful.
- Agent drawer defaults to the Activity tab; Recordings/Context move into a
  More menu.
- Stall honesty: NeedsYou no longer includes "suspected-stuck" (a slow-but-
  alive agent is not a decision); member-row stall thresholds raised to
  15/15/30 min with factual labels.

### Fixed
- The dispatch task card could never render (known-id seeding effect raced the
  new-agent detection effect — every roster change marked all agents known
  first); fixed with render-time lazy init. Attach window widened to 180s for
  LLM-paced dispatches (a real 71s dispatch was missing the old 15s window).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-20

New engine: **Kimi Code** (`kimi`) joins the swarm as a first-class PTY
engine, on par with claude/codex — spawn, wake, multi-agent delegation,
activity, and usage all verified live and in a real browser (Playwright).

### Added
- **Kimi Code engine** (`cli-plugins/kimi.toml` + `cli/kimi.rs`): OAuth
  subscription billing (`billing_surface = interactive-subscription`),
  `--yolo` auto-approve, ambient `KIMI_MODEL_*` API-key override blocked by
  default, `swarmx-mcp wake-check --hook-format kimi` Stop-hook protocol
  (stderr + exit 2) patched idempotently into the user-level
  `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`.
- **Keystroke bootstrap hardening for large prompts**: new manifest fields
  `bracketed_paste` (explicit `ESC[200~…201~` framing) and
  `bootstrap_ready_needle` / `bootstrap_ready_settle_ms` (gate the paste on
  the TUI's own settled banner). Fixes a live-verified race where kimi's TUI
  silently ate the ~26KB bootstrap before its input pipeline was ready.
- **kimi transcript tailer**: `transcript.rs` now tails
  `~/.kimi-code/sessions/wd_*_<sha256(cwd)[:12]>/<session>/agents/main/
  wire.jsonl`, feeding the Activity view (`tool.call`/`tool.result`) and the
  Usage page (`usage.record`, `kimi-code/*` models) — previously both were
  empty for kimi.

### Changed
- **kimi MCP injection relies on env inheritance**: `.kimi-code/mcp.json`
  carries no per-agent values (verified: kimi's stdio MCP children inherit
  the parent's env), so same-workspace agents can no longer overwrite each
  other's MCP identity (the reasonix/zulu class of bug).
- `swarm_spawn_worker`'s `cli` enum, fusion `valid_clis`, and the autopilot
  fusion panel now include `kimi` (and `zulu`); the first-response watchdog
  gives transcript-less engines (incl. kimi) a 150s window.
- `roles/orchestrator.md`'s engine-selection guidance covers kimi.

## [Unreleased]

Production-readiness hardening from the 2026-06 maturity audit
(`docs/maturity-audit-2026-06.md`).

### Added
- **Database safety net**: pre-migration `VACUUM INTO` snapshots, corrupt-DB
  detection (`PRAGMA quick_check`) with quarantine + rebuild on open, and a
  migration upper-bound guard that refuses to run an older binary against a
  newer schema.
- **Liveness reaper**: a periodic sweep that retires any agent whose child
  process actually died without emitting a `ShimExit`, killing the "forever
  green dot" fake state.
- **`swarmx-server doctor`** preflight self-check (shim/mcp binaries, CLIs on
  PATH, free port, writable data dir) and an `effective config` startup dump.
- **Periodic retention prune** (every 6h), now also covering the high-frequency
  `agent_usage` / `agent_activities` tables.
- **Daily-rolled file logging** under `~/.swarmx/logs/`.
- **Frontend tests in CI**: vitest unit tests (DAG-edge derivation invariants) +
  Playwright e2e as hard gates; ESLint flat config (react-hooks); cargo-audit +
  npm audit + Dependabot.
- `docs/configuration.md` documenting every `SWARMX_*` variable (harness-check
  guards completeness); a top-level `LICENSE` (MIT).

### Changed
- **Tauri**: closing the main window now quits the app and terminates the
  bundled server sidecar (no more orphaned server holding port 7777).
- **Versioning**: a single source of truth via `scripts/bump-version.mjs`;
  releases are now gated on CI (`cargo test` + harness) passing.
- Migration registry refactored to a `MIGRATIONS` array (harness-check updated).

### Security
- **File browser**: hard denylist for credential paths (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`,
  `*.pem`/`*.key`, `~/.claude.json`, …) on every request, even with `all=1`.
- **DNS-rebind defense**: no-Origin requests now also require a loopback `Host`.
- **Panic isolation**: a handler panic returns 500 for that request instead of
  dropping the whole connection; the server now drains on SIGINT/SIGTERM.
